# Welcome to Remix + Vite!

ðŸ“– See the [Remix docs](https://remix.run/docs) and the [Remix Vite docs](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/future/vite) for details on supported features.

## Development

Run the Vite dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`




### Remix basic setup

This dependency relies on Remix vite installation.

```
npm create vite@latest
```

Once you run that command create a new project name, select React framework and Remix variant.

```
âœ” Project name: â€¦ remix-paraglidejs-example
âœ” Select a framework: â€º React
âœ” Select a variant: â€º Remix â†—
```

After a few more question that you will have a basic Remix app.

### ParaglideJS

Initialize paraglide-js whith:

```
npx @inlang/paraglide-js@latest init
```

You have to answer this when it asks you about the stack.

```
Which tech stack are you using? Vite
```

Now you have the ParaglideJS setup. Check [official usage doc](https://inlang.com/m/gerre34r/library-inlang-paraglideJs#usage) or our example.
